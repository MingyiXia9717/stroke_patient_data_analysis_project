# stroke_patient_data_analysis_project
Independent data analysis project during CIT590 (Programming Languages and Techniques)

**Project Mentor**: Mengting Zhang

**Project Summary**:

The goal of this project is to analyze the important factors that contribute to stroke events in patients. We will first clean and explore the stroke patient dataset, and then we will build a logistic regression model to predict stroke events in patients.

**Data Source**:

[Kaggle Stroke Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset)

**Skills Applied**:
1. Data cleaning and manipulation (with pandas)
2. Data visualization (with seaborn)
3. Automated feature selection (recursive feature elimination with cross validation)
4. Logistic regression modeling (with sklearn)
5. Model evaluation (ROC curve)

**Result**:

 Our final model yields 96% accuracy in predicting stroke events in patients.
